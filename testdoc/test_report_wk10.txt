
Preliminary setup: No problems, everything worked from the getgo.

1) Creating Users
a. All users were successfully created, and all errors/invalid input were reported and not inserted into the database.
2) Logging In
a. All users could log in and invalid input resulted in an error screen.
3) Adding Facilities
a. All facilities were adding correctly into the database, all duplicate entries threw error pages.
4) Adding Assets
a. All assets were correctly added into the database, and the duplicate entry threw the error page.
5) Asset Disposal
a. All user role validation worked correctly
b. All asset disposals worked correctly, with disposed assets being recorded in the database as disposed
6) Transfer Process
a. All user role validation worked correctly
b. All request timelines worked correctly (could not load/unload before previous timestamps)
c. There was no error page presented for incorrect timestamp validation (this could be on purpose, I don’t think this was necessary in the guidelines but I could be wrong)
7) Reports
a. All reports were functional and reported the correct data at the correct times.
8) Database queries
a. All database queries reported the appropriate data as per the test document.

Extra test feedback:
* All functionality worked 100%
* All role validation worked 100%
* As indicated in 6c, maybe put in an error page when the time is not submitted correctly. Other than that, looks really good and is completely functional. Good work!
